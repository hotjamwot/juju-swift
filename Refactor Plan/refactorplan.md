# 🚀 Juju Refactor: The Narrative Engine

**The Vision:** Transform Juju from a time tracker into a storytelling companion that celebrates your creative journey.

---

## 🎯 WHY WE'RE REFACTORING

### The Problem
Juju currently shows raw numbers and tags, but it doesn't tell the story of your creative career. You can see hours logged, but not the narrative of growth, progress, and achievement.

### The Solution
A narrative-driven dashboard that transforms data into meaningful stories about your creative work, while maintaining the frictionless experience you love.

---

## 📖 THE STORY WE WANT TO TELL

### 1. **Your Creative Identity**
- **Activity Types** (Writing, Editing, Admin) show how you work
- **Project Phases** (Draft 1, Editing, Production) show where you are
- **Milestones** mark your significant achievements

### 2. **Your Progress Over Time**
- **Hero Section** becomes an editorial summary: "This week you focused on Writing, reaching milestone: Finished Act I"
- **Activity Bubble Chart** visualizes your creative balance
- **Annual Project Story** shows each project's journey like a bullet journal

### 3. **Your Creative Legacy**
- Data organized by year for performance and clarity
- Structured information that AI can understand and enhance
- A timeline that celebrates your growth as a creator

## 🛠️ THE FOUNDATION (Phase 1)

**Schema Evolution:**
- Sessions track Activity Type + Project Phase + Milestones
- Projects have structured phases instead of messy tags
- Activity Types with emojis make data human-readable

**Performance Revolution:**

## 🎨 THE EXPERIENCE (Phases 2-3)
