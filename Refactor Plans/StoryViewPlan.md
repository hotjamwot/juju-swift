# 🌟 Project Story System

## PROJECT STORY VIEW: **The Narrative Surface**

### Purpose

Turn a single project into a **readable, human story**.

This is where:

* phases matter
* milestones belong
* memory and meaning live

---

### 🧩 This Is a Separate View (Swipe / Tab)

This is **not** a dashboard panel.
It’s a destination.

Think:

> “I want to *remember* what happened here.”

---

### 📖 The Visual Concept — *Project Story Timeline*

A **horizontal timeline**, read left → right, like a book.

**Structure:**

* **X-axis:** Time (weeks or days, depending on zoom)
* **Y-axis:** Project phases (Draft 1, Draft 2, Edit, Polish, etc.)
* **Bands:**

  * Show active periods within each phase
  * Gaps are meaningful and visible

**Milestones:**

* ⭐ Star markers placed on the timeline
* Optional short labels
* Simple native tooltip on hover for milestone text

**Sessions:**

* Implicit via band presence or subtle density
* No dot spam
* No micromanagement of duration

---

### 🧪 Build This in Tiny Steps

**Step 1:**
Render a horizontal timeline for one project with time only.

**Step 2:**
Add phase rows (static, no data yet).

**Step 3:**
Fill bands where sessions exist.

**Step 4:**
Overlay milestone stars (no labels at first).

**Step 5:**
Add tooltips / short labels once spacing is proven.

Each step should compile, render, and *feel useful* on its own.

## 🎭 Emotional Contract (Important)

### Focus Map Should Feel:

* Neutral
* Observational
* Slightly sobering, but kind

### Project Story Should Feel:

* Personal
* Celebratory
* Memory-like, not analytical

If either view starts to feel stressful, it’s doing the wrong job.

---

## 🎯 Success Indicators (Reframed)

### Behavioural

* Users glance at the Focus Map without needing explanation
* Users linger in the Project Story view
* Users say “oh yeah… that’s when that happened”

### Emotional

* Pride without pressure
* Insight without judgement
* Motivation without gamification

---

## 🧱 What We Are *Not* Doing (Yet)

* No “ultimate yearly everything view”
* No combining activities, phases, milestones, and stats in one surface
* No cleverness that can’t be read in under 5 seconds

This plan explicitly resists ambition creep.

---

## 🧠 Final Framing (Keep This)

**Yearly Dashboard:**

> *“How did my year feel?”*

**Project Story View:**

> *“What did I actually build?”*

That separation is the spine of the product now.
