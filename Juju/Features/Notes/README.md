# SwiftUI Notes Migration

This document describes the migration of the Notes feature from a hybrid NSWindow + WebKit approach to fully native SwiftUI.

## Overview

The Notes feature has been completely rewritten to use SwiftUI instead of WebKit/HTML, providing better performance, native feel, and easier maintenance.

## Architecture

### New Components

1. **NotesViewModel** (`NotesViewModel.swift`)
   - Manages the state of the notes modal
   - Handles user input validation
   - Provides keyboard shortcut handling
   - Uses `@Published` properties for SwiftUI reactivity

2. **NotesModalView** (`NotesModalView.swift`)
   - Native SwiftUI view for the notes modal
   - Replaces the HTML-based modal
   - Includes mood selector with emoji interface
   - Maintains the same visual design as the original
   - Supports keyboard shortcuts (⌘+Enter to save, Esc to cancel)

3. **NotesManager** (`NotesManager.swift`)
   - Singleton class that manages the presentation of the notes modal
   - Handles window creation and lifecycle
   - Provides a clean API for showing the modal
   - Maintains compatibility with the existing completion handler pattern

### Legacy Components (Deprecated)

- `NotesModalViewController.swift` - Can be removed
- `NotesModalWindowController.swift` - Can be removed

## Integration

### MenuManager Changes

The `MenuManager` has been updated to use the new `NotesManager` instead of the old `NotesModalWindowController`:

```swift
// Old approach
private var notesWindowController: NotesModalWindowController?

// New approach
private var notesManager = NotesManager.shared
```

The `endCurrentSession()` method now calls:

```swift
notesManager.present { [weak self] (note: String?, mood: Int?) in
    // Handle completion
}
```

## Features

### Preserved Functionality

- ✅ Modal presentation with centered positioning
- ✅ Text editing with placeholder
- ✅ Save/Cancel buttons with keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ Mood selection (1-5 scale with emojis)
- ✅ Session ending with notes and mood
- ✅ Proper window focus management
- ✅ Visual styling matching the original design

### New Features

- ✅ Native SwiftUI text editing
- ✅ Improved keyboard handling
- ✅ Better performance (no WebKit overhead)
- ✅ Native macOS feel
- ✅ Easier maintenance and customization

## Usage

### Presenting Notes Modal

```swift
// Using the NotesManager directly
NotesManager.shared.present { notes, mood in
    if let notes = notes, !notes.isEmpty {
        // Save notes with mood
        sessionManager.endSession(notes: notes, mood: mood)
    } else {
        // User cancelled
    }
}
```

### Customizing the Notes Modal

The `NotesModalView` can be customized by modifying:

- Colors in the view (currently matching the original dark theme)
- Mood selector options
- Button styles
- Layout and spacing

## Visual Design

The new SwiftUI modal maintains the same visual appearance as the original:

- **Background**: Dark theme (#181A1B)
- **Text**: Light gray (#F5F5F7)
- **Accent**: Purple (#8F5AFF)
- **Borders**: Dark gray (#2C2C2C)
- **Dimensions**: 600x400 points (minimum 400x300)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **⌘+Enter**: Save notes and close modal
- **Escape**: Cancel and close modal
- **Standard text editing shortcuts**: ⌘+C, ⌘+V, ⌘+X, ⌘+A, ⌘+Z

## Migration Steps

1. ✅ Created `NotesViewModel.swift`
2. ✅ Created `NotesModalView.swift`
3. ✅ Created `NotesManager.swift`
4. ✅ Updated `MenuManager.swift`
5. ⏳ Remove old files (optional)
6. ⏳ Test the implementation

## Testing

To test the new Notes system:

1. Start a session for any project
2. Click "End Session" from the menu bar
3. Verify the SwiftUI modal appears
4. Test text editing functionality
5. Test mood selector
6. Test keyboard shortcuts
7. Verify session ends correctly with notes

## Benefits

### Performance
- No WebKit process overhead
- Faster loading and rendering
- Lower memory usage

### Maintainability
- Pure Swift/SwiftUI code
- No HTML/CSS/JavaScript to maintain
- Easier to debug and modify
- Better IDE support

### User Experience
- Native macOS feel
- Better text editing experience
- Improved keyboard handling
- Smoother animations

## Future Enhancements

The SwiftUI architecture makes it easier to add:

- Rich text formatting
- Tags and categories
- Templates for common notes
- Auto-save functionality
- Search and filtering
- Export options

## Compatibility

The new system maintains full compatibility with:

- Existing `SessionManager` integration
- CSV data storage format
- Menu bar integration
- Session lifecycle management

No changes are required to other parts of the application.
